(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

United States irrespective of any provision of State law-

by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure

in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to

been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.

limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred

handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.**
**    (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.*

Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor

matter and makes full disclosure of the financial interest and receives 
in advance a written determination made by such official that the 
interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the 
integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such 
officer or employee;
         (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of 
Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and 
employees covered by this section, and published in the Federal

after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved; or
         (4) if the financial interest that would be affected by the 
particular matter involved is that resulting solely from the interest of 
the officer or employee, or his or her spouse or minor child, in

group or community, including any Alaska Native village corporation as

community, or Alaska Native village corporation as a specific party or 
parties.
     (c)(1) For the purpose of paragraph (1) of subsection (b), in the 
case of class A and B directors of Federal Reserve banks, the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall be deemed to be the 
Government official responsible for appointment.

paragraph of subsection (b) does not preclude an exemption being granted 
pursuant to another paragraph of subsection (b).
     (d)(1) Upon request, a copy of any determination granting an 
exemption under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(3) shall be made available to 
the public by the agency granting the exemption pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 
1978. In making such determination available, the agency may withhold 
from disclosure any information contained in the determination that 
would be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5. For 
purposes of determinations under subsection (b)(3), the information 
describing each financial interest shall be no more extensive than that 
required of the individual in his or her financial disclosure report 
under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.
     (2) The Office of Government Ethics, after consultation with the 
Attorney General, shall issue uniform regulations for the issuance of 
waivers and exemptions under subsection (b) which shall-

              -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit

          law-<br>
                  (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed,

          all property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine
          otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a defendant who
          derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined
          not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.<br>
              (b) Procedures.-<br>
                  (1) General.<br>
                  -Property subject to forfeiture under this section,
          any seizure and disposition thereof, and any administrative or
          judicial proceeding in relation thereto, shall be governed by
          subsections (b) through (p) of section 413 of the
          Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970
          (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those
          subsections to-<br>
                      (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be
          deemed to be a reference to section 229A(a); and<br>
                      (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a
          reference to subsection (a) of this section.<br>
                  (2) Temporary restraining orders.-<br>
                      (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture
          proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order
          may be entered upon application of the United States without
          notice or opportunity for a hearing when an information or
          indictment has not yet been filed with respect to the
          property, if, in addition to the circumstances described in
          section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention
          and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United
          States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe
          that the property with respect to which the order is sought
          would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture
          under this section and exigent circumstances exist that place
          the life or health of any person in danger.<br>
                      (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a
          temporary restraining order under this paragraph, it shall
          also issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of such property.<br>
                      (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and
          time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under
          section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
          Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and
          (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining orders under this
          paragraph.    <br>
              (c) Affirmative Defense.<br>
                  -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture
          under subsection (b) that the property-<br>
                  (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical
          Weapons Convention; and<br>
                  (2) is of a type and quantity that under the
          circumstances is consistent with that purpose.<br>
              (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General
          shall provide for the destruction or other appropriate
          disposition of any chemical weapon seized and forfeited
          pursuant to this section.<br>
              (e) Assistance.<br>
              (f) Owner Liability.<br>
                  -The owner or possessor of any property seized under
          this section shall be liable to the United States for any
          expenses incurred incident to the seizure, including any
          expenses relating to the handling, storage, transportation,
          and destruction or other disposition of the seized property</font></font></p>

        of this title.<br>
            (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-<br>
                (1) if the officer or employee first advises the
        Government official responsible for appointment to his or her

        all officers and employees covered by this section, and
        published in the Federal Register, the financial interest has

        disclosure report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics
        in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need

        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which is recognized as
        eligible for the special programs and services provided by the
        United States to Indians because of their status as Indians,<br>

        held in trust by the United States or which is inalienable by
        the allottee without the consent of the United States, or<br>
                    (C) in an Indian claims fund held in trust or
        administered by the United States,<br>

        deemed to be the Government official responsible for
        appointment.<br>

        particular paragraph of subsection (b) does not preclude an
        exemption being granted pursuant to another paragraph of
        subsection (b).<br>

        available to the public by the agency granting the exemption
        pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 105 of the
        Ethics in Government Act of 1978. In making such determination
        available, the agency may withhold from disclosure any
        information contained in the determination that would be exempt
        from disclosure under section 552 of title 5. For purposes of
        determinations under subsection (b)(3), the information
        describing each financial interest shall be no more extensive
        than that required of the individual in his or her financial
        disclosure report under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.<br>
            (2) The Office of Government Ethics, after consultation with
        the Attorney General, shall issue uniform regulations for the
        issuance of waivers and exemptions under subsection (b) which
        shall-<br>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> I don’t know I tried the SEC, FINRA, and other but they
        actually believe they are not under investigation it’s amazing…
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>I’m trying to help them to turn themselves in having
          accrued over 100 years of minimum sentences in my pad, without
          looking at the OX. </div>
        <div><br>

        <div>As individuals, not combined.. and their Corporations each
          have managed to win a $20 million dollar fine, and $10 million
          each as individuals under one section alone…</div>
        <div>   </div>
        <div>At least think about the integrity of the market
          participants before you lead them to believe this as a laissez
          fairer Investment Adviser community also?</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>Listen don’t believe it, because in a way— it’s entrapment
          .. so don’t ever bring yourself to that low of a point.. or
          around the investment community at all. Ladies and gentleman,
          you already know it, but even if they slipped the cuffs for
          two years, it’s a guaranteed long term sentence and serious
          fines.</div>

        <div>This Zucker group:</div>

          otherwise… lord have mercy they will not even claim their own
          zipcode to avoid prosecution.</div>
        <div>- I don’t care about the money at all, they are going to
          cause misleading information and false pretenses onto the few
          and found, or all of them. If you ask Shari, you will put her
          away for life as soon as she opens her mouth.</div>

        <div>Look, I promise:</div>

        <div>They have your home address, and you can trust me I helped
          them out with something about ten years ago…  I know how to
          simplify, iceberg and I will move whatever, and in

        <div>Those are minimum terms, not controversial. Minimums,
          double digits… as in 18.21 + 18.225, + 18.2 is a guaranteed
          long term sentence, add those number up and divide it by the
          log base 21 of two for a lower bound, would be my guess for a
          merciful combine. Unfortunately, there are several of them for
          each of you.</div>

          all have done enough damage as it is, and I would hate to see
          anything happen to the good ones, thinking it’s OK to commit
          several counts of securities fraud, stack up a few felonies
          and breach the OX - those are 20-40 year minimums for each
          count in certain sections, like USC 18.225 has a minimum
