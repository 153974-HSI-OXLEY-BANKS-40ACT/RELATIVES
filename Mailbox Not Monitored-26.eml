Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction 
any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was associated with an 
investment adviser, if the Commission finds that the sanction is in the 
public interest and the person has been convicted of any offense 
specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).

On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of fortyeight 
months, to run concurrently on all counts, followed by three years of 
supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $390,243,873.92 
and to forfeit $2,223,000.

15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2)(A).
Ex. C at 1-2; Exs. D, E. The superseding indictment charged Balboa with, 
among other things, engaging in a scheme to falsely inflate the value of 
illiquid securities between January 2008 and October 2008 and with

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.



TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

         In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective 
date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and 
is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one 
year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered 
investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if 
prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have 
filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective 
provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with 
this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed 
shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

> (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in

> purchase from such registered company, or from any company controlled 
> by such registered company, any security or other property (except 
> securities of which the seller is the issuer) Liability of directors, 
> etc., for willful misfeasance. SEC. 17. (h) After one year from the 
> effective date of this title, neither the charter, certificate of 
> incorporation, articles of association, indenture of trust, nor the 
> by-laws of any registered investment company, nor any other instrument 
> pursuant to which such a company is organized or administered, shall 
> contain any provision which protects or purports to protect any

> company or to its security holders to which he would otherwise be 
> subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence

> subsection (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the 
> expiration of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to 
> be a registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate

> officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of 
> any protective provision of the instrument to the extent that it does 
> not comply with this subsection, and each such person subsequently 
> elected or appointed shall before assuming office file a similar

> Injunctions against gross abuse. SEC. 36. The Commission is authorized

> commencement of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of 
> trust in respect of any registered investment company for which such 
> person so serves or acts: (1) as officer, director, member of an 
> advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor; or (2) as principal 
> underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end company, unit 
> investment trust, or face-amount certificate company. If the
