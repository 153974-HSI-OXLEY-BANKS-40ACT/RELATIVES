regarding the work conducted in the residence, which was completed as 
referenced in the latter images entered; the Mirror was hung in good taste.

x._ITEM 23_

superintendent’s coordination of Defendants’ purported residents and 
entered a photograph of cigarette butts and used this image on several 
occasions as referenced in the AFFIDAVITS of the earlier BRANDON as 
entered in the County of Alameda, in the State of California, which is 
also not in the ZIP-CODE 10018.

xi._ITEM 24_

11 April 2020.Defendants attest and document to several emails 
circulated internally by Defendants which in this case the Defendant was 
in the State of California, Notarized the same and entered separately in 
the ANNEXED email in EX04 – entered an additional Docket Number 14 under 
the false light of Alexis Brandon under the auspice of the ZUCKERS 
distributed, tampered, adjusted, and have not returned any photographs 
or videos as requested in email, letter, and by telephone – 
notwithstanding myself positioned and “…banging on the radiator…” on the 
27^TH of April, 2020 – which I affirmas ANNEXED in the AFFIDAVIT of 
MIWAKO G. MESSER, as I recall this intimate encounter in the flesh – was 
a trespass of the sanctity of my home while in the nude as seen from the 
corridor and the gazing eyes ANNEXED and entered by Defendants in the 
matter.

xii._ITEM 25_

11 April 2020.Defendants attest and document to the mother of a 
resident, ANNE BRANDON – after having entered the AFFIDAVIT of ALEXIS 
BRANDON entered on the 11^th of APRIL and the AFFIDAVIT of MIWAKO G.

entered and sworn to by Defendants in the matter, notwithstanding Miss 
Ashley Humphries who notarized the Affidavit of John Doe as furthered 
hereunder on behalf of the ELSERS and the unlawful fees collected by the 
ZUCKERS, per the terms of their own lease.

xiii._ITEM 27_

13 April 2020.//Defendants attest and document to circulating emails by 
and between the principles of the ZUCKER, namely Laurie Zucker, Anne 
Brandon, Paul Regan, Cory Weiss, and other members named above 
re-iterate that ALEXIS BRANDON is leaving the building, after 
demonstrating that she was already in California on the 11^TH while ANNE 
BRANDON was purported to be writing emails to the named defendants in 
the matter who in fact harassed me at all times demonstrably as 
referenced in _ITEM 4_ as a tenant in one of their properties and 
throughout the term and lease agreement which terminated on the 31^ST of 
December, 2020 whereby my STUDIO was understood to be their “Premises” 
under which I was photographed, documented in the AFFIDAVITS of their 
residents, and purported as legal residents of the building and address 
where I resided in the County of New York, addressed formerly at 111 
Sullivan Street, APT 2BR, New York, NY 10012.

xiv._ITEM 28_

15 April 2020.//Defendants attest and document to circulating emails by 
and between the /NEXUS/ of the ZUCKERS, whereby the window which 
provides egress to the fire-escape was damaged, boarded-up and was not 
repaired at any point in time. Despite the requests for EMERGENCY 
access, was deemed as appropriate in the ORAL ARGUMENT of SHARI S. 
LASKOWITZ, who on behalf of the YUZERS represented the interests of the 
ZUCKERS documented myself as locked out and capable of entering the 
premises as a basis of fitness. It was deemed of no consequence or 
urgency, as the Defendants in this matter were also neglectful of my 
physical health as furthered hereunder, despite the continuance as 
“chronicled” in the daily recount of my personal life. As referenced 
previously and during the time period referenced under _ITEM 4_ – 
obsessively would document each and every aspect of my life, certain of 
those claims are in fact a perjury under Federal and State Law, as sworn 
to under the AFFIDAVITS notarized by the ZUCKERS, YUZERS, and the ELSERS.

xv._ITEM 29_

19 April 2020.//Defendants attest and document to circulating 
communications by and between the /NEXUS/ of ZUCKERS, whereby I was

communications by and between the /NEXUS/ of ZUCKERS, whereby I was 
documented as owner of a “tape gun”, while videotaping, recording, and 
documenting my every step and motion referenced previously and during 
the time period referenced under _ITEM 4_ – obsessively and without my 
consent, destroyed the sanctity of my home in their coordinated 
observations entered by and on behalf of the ZUCKERS, YUZERS, and ELSERS 
was admittedly documented as closing my door was entered in the FEDERAL 
record as such and “twice in an hour’s time.” – which demonstrates a 
scrutinized violation of my privacy by all the NEXUS of Defendants named 
in the caption of this matter, sworn to under the AFFIDAVITS notarized 
by the ZUCKERS, YUZERS, and the ELSERS.

xvii._ITEM 32_

communications by and between the /NEXUS/ of ZUCKERS, whereby I was 
documented “…banging on the radiator…” as referenced on the same date by 
as ANNEXED in the AFFIDAVIT of MIWAKO G. MESSER, whereby she attests to 
the location and departure of ALEXIS BRANDON, who notarized the letter 
on the same date emailed by her mother, purportedly as entered by 
Defendants in the matter – was more likely than not tampered with.

xix._ITEM 34_

28 April 2020.//Defendants attest and document to circulating 
communications by and between the /NEXUS/ of ZUCKERS, in furtherance of 
myself documented “…banging on the radiator…” through the door was

between the /NEXUS/ of ZUCKERS, YUZERS and ELSERS and disdain to my 
culinary skills, as furthered hereunder was also introduced as a 
coordination of emails, as purported, by two building residents who 
allegedly resided in their Premises located at 111 Sullivan Street, New 
York, NY 10012.

xxx._ITEM 47_

24 May 2020.Defendants again document to circulating emails by and 
between the /NEXUS/ of ZUCKERS, YUZERS and ELSERS and have an ongoing 
problem of flooding in the building, despite having a collection of 
written, photographed, videotaped, and recorded audio continue to place 
blame on myself for a 1/8” inch hole which was reported on the 28^TH of

threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands,

***(15)    <**voicemail attached>*

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands,

***(15)    <**voicemail attached>*

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or

been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.**

engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.*

              prosecution under this section that, under circumstances
              manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his
              criminal intent, the defendant prevented the commission of
              the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and
              complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a
              decision to postpone the commission of the crime until
              another time or to substitute another victim or another
              but similar objective. If the defendant raises the
              affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden
              of proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
              (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this
              section that the person solicited could not be convicted
              of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required
              for its commission, because he was incompetent or
              irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or
              is not subject to prosecution.

              cause to believe that the property with respect to which
              the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be
              subject to forfeiture under this section and exigent
              circumstances exist that place the life or health of any
              person in danger. (B) Warrant of seizure.-If the court
              enters a temporary restraining order under this paragraph,
              it shall also issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of
              such property. (C) Applicable procedures.-The procedures
              and time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders
              under section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug
              Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C.
              853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining
              orders under this paragraph. (c) Affirmative Defense. -It
              is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under
              subsection (b) that the property- (1) is for a purpose not
              prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention; and (2)
              is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is
              consistent with that purpose. (d) Destruction or Other
              Disposition.-The Attorney General shall provide for the
              destruction or other appropriate disposition of any
              chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this
              section. (e) Assistance. (f) Owner Liability. -The owner
              or possessor of any property seized under this section
              shall be liable to the United States for any expenses
              incurred incident to the seizure, including any expenses
              relating to the handling, storage, transportation, and
              destruction or other disposition of the seized property

              financial interest- -Shall be subject to the penalties set
              forth in section 216 of this title. (b) Subsection (a)
              shall not apply- (1) if the officer or employee first
              advises the Government official responsible for
              appointment to his or her position of the nature and
              circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding,
              application, request for a ruling or other determination,
              contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest,
              or other particular matter and makes full disclosure of
              the financial interest and receives in advance a written
              determination made by such official that the interest is
              not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the
              integrity of the services which the Government may expect
              from such officer or employee; (2) if, by regulation
              issued by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics,
              applicable to all or a portion of all officers and
              employees covered by this section, and published in the
              Federal Register, the financial interest has been exempted
              from the requirements of subsection (a) as being too
              remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of
              the services of the Government officers or employees to
              which such regulation applies; (3) in the case of a
              special Government employee serving on an advisory
              committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory
              Committee Act (including an individual being considered
              for an appointment to such a position), the official
              responsible for the employee's appointment, after review
              of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual
              pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978,
              certifies in writing that the need for the individual's
              services outweighs the potential for a conflict of
              interest created by the financial interest involved; or
              (4) if the financial interest that would be affected by
              the particular matter involved is that resulting solely
              from the interest of the officer or employee, or his or
              her spouse or minor child, in birthrights- (A) in an
              Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or
              community, including any Alaska Native village corporation
              as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native
              Claims Settlement Act, which is recognized as eligible for
              the special programs and services provided by the United
              States to Indians because of their status as Indians, (B)
              in an Indian allotment the title to which is held in trust
              by the United States or which is inalienable by the
              allottee without the consent of the United States, or (C)
              in an Indian claims fund held in trust or administered by
              the United States, -if the particular matter does not
              involve the Indian allotment or claims fund or the Indian
              tribe, band, nation, organized group or community, or
              Alaska Native village corporation as a specific party or
              parties. (c)(1) For the purpose of paragraph (1) of
              subsection (b), in the case of class A and B directors of
              Federal Reserve banks, the Board of Governors of the
              Federal Reserve System shall be deemed to be the
              Government official responsible for appointment. (2) The
              potential availability of an exemption under any
              particular paragraph of subsection (b) does not preclude
              an exemption being granted pursuant to another paragraph
              of subsection (b). (d)(1) Upon request, a copy of any
              determination granting an exemption under subsection
              (b)(1) or (b)(3) shall be made available to the public by
              the agency granting the exemption pursuant to the
              procedures set forth in section 105 of the Ethics in
              Government Act of 1978. In making such determination
              available, the agency may withhold from disclosure any
              information contained in the determination that would be
              exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5. For
              purposes of determinations under subsection (b)(3), the
              information describing each financial interest shall be no
              more extensive than that required of the individual in his
              or her financial disclosure report under the Ethics in
              Government Act of 1978. (2) The Office of Government
              Ethics, after consultation with the Attorney General,
              shall issue uniform regulations for the issuance of
              waivers and exemptions under subsection (b) which shall-
              (A) list and describe exemptions; and (B) provide guidance
              with respect to the types of interests that are not so
              substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity
              of the services the Government may expect from the
              employee. /***** //§118. Interference with certain

              I am terrified, where is he ? Touching himself or making
              videos with my Glamour shots. Thats actually a compound,
              in the scope of avoidance to prosecution. Truly a
