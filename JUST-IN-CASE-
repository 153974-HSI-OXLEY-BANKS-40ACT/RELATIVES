HOW MANY FIRMS DOES IT TAKE TO LOSE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF MARKET CAP - AND HIDE IT FROM THE INVESTORS...

https://github.com/BSCPGROUPHOLDINGSLLC/ELSER-AND-DICKER/commit/3062fcf9c989174cbc76ea0b7d8135cf32eef8f4

THAT’S TWO BILLION USD IN RESTITUTION THAT IS ALREADY OWED TO INVESTORS....

NOT INCLUDING THE 9 BILLION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENTS LOST, AND NO LONGER UNDER FILER 93715.
 	 PRIOR TO LITIGATION WITH THE REGULATORY FINES – IS WAY MORE THAN THAT.
