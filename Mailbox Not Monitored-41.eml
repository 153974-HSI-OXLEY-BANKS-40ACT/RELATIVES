USC 18, § 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence (a) Whoever, 
with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a felony 
that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of 
physical force against property or against the person of another in 
violation of the laws of the United States, and under circumstances 
strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, induces, or 
otherwise endeavors to persuade such other person to engage in such 
conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of 
imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more than 
one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the crime 
solicited, or both; or if the crime solicited is punishable by life 
imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty 
years.* * ***(15) <**voicemail attached>* (b) It is an affirmative 
defense to a prosecution under this section that, under circumstances 
manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal 
intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A 
renunciation is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole 
or in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until 
another time or to substitute another victim or another but similar 
objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defense at trial, the 
defendant has the burden of proving the defense by a preponderance of 
the evidence. (c) It is not a defense to a prosecution under this 
section that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime 
because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because 
he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from 
prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.

real or personal, owned, possessed, or used by a person involved in the 
offense; (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to

in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in addition to any 
other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that the person 
forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. 
In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a defendant 
who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not 
more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds. (b) Procedures.- 
(1) General. -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any 
seizure and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial 
proceeding in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) 
through (p) of section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention 
and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under

forfeiture proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order 
may be entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger. (B) Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property. (C) Applicable procedures.-The 
procedures and time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders 
under section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse 
Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall 
apply to temporary restraining orders under this paragraph. (c) 
Affirmative Defense. -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture 
under subsection (b) that the property- (1) is for a purpose not 
prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention; and (2) is of a type 
and quantity that under the circumstances is consistent with that 
purpose. (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General 
shall provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of 
any chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section. (e) 
Assistance. (f) Owner Liability. -The owner or possessor of any property

=C2=A7229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
    (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
    -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the Unit=
ed States irrespective of any provision of State law-

        (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds the =
person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation;=
 and
        (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, or=
 to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

    The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in addit=
ion to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that the p=
erson forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsect=
ion. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a defenda=
nt who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not=
 more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
    (b) Procedures.-
        (1) General.
        -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure a=
nd disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding in =
relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of sec=
tion 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 19=
70 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those subsections to-=

a reference to section 229A(a); and
            (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to sub=
section (a) of this section.
        (2) Temporary restraining orders.-

s under this section, a temporary restraining order may be entered upon a=
pplication of the United States without notice or opportunity for a heari=

n 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of=
 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United States demonstrates that there is=
 probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the or=
der is sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture=
 under this section and exigent circumstances exist that place the life o=
r health of any person in danger.
            (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary r=
estraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant auth=

 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining orders un=
der this paragraph.
    (c) Affirmative Defense.
        -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under subsecti=
on (b) that the property-
        (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Co=
nvention; and
        (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is con=
sistent with that purpose.
    (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall prov=
ide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any chemical =
weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
    (e) Assistance.

to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the handling, storage,=
 transportation, and destruction or other disposition of the seized prope=
rty
