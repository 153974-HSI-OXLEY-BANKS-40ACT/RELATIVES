PART 1.01 WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION, ENTERED IS AN INVASION OF MY PRIVACY BY 
DEFENDANTS IN THE CAPTION AS REFERENCED HEREUNDER.
ARTIFACT NUMBER [1] NYSCEF DOCKET 32: THE AFFIDAVIT OF MIWAKO G. MESSER.
(i) ANNEXED here is [X01], EXHIBIT 1 and in the AFFIDAVIT of MIWAKO G. 
MESSER aided and abetted the invasion of my privacy, demonstrably in her 
daily recount of my personal life and as part a part of her daily tasks 
and affairs attested further under penalty of perjury:
1) Observed from the corridor myself positioned and in her 22ND item of 
record, on the 27TH of April - myself as:
“…banging against the radiator…”
ARTIFACT NUMBER [2] ANNEXED here is [X02], EXHIBIT 2, and in, 
consideration of the ARTIFACT NUMBER [1], as ANNEXED IN THIS MATTER as 
items X01 and X02:
viii. ITEM 21
3 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to a “…chronicle…” in light 
of the 1/8” hole that was drilled and reported on the 28TH of March, as 
a basis of cause for the six hundred dollars in damages paid to replace 
a light fixture and paint a wall;
2 April 2020. Attest and document to myself using a hammer.
2 April 2020. Attest and document to myself building a bed.
2 April 2020. Attest and document myself hanging two chandeliers from 
the ceiling.

ix. ITEM 22
3 April 2020. Defendants attest and document another resident email 
regarding the work conducted in the residence, which was completed as 
referenced in the latter images entered; the Mirror was hung in good taste.
x. ITEM 23
4 April 2020. Defendants attest and document the building 
superintendent’s coordination of Defendants’ purported residents and 
entered a photograph of cigarette butts and used this image on several 
occasions as referenced in the AFFIDAVITS of the earlier BRANDON as 
entered in the County of Alameda, in the State of California, which is 
also not in the ZIP-CODE 10018.
xi. ITEM 24
11 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to several emails 
circulated internally by Defendants which in this case the Defendant was 
in the State of California, Notarized the same and entered separately in 
the ANNEXED email in EX04 – entered an additional Docket Number 14 under 
the false light of Alexis Brandon under the auspice of the ZUCKERS 
distributed, tampered, adjusted, and have not returned any photographs 
or videos as requested in email, letter, and by telephone – 
notwithstanding myself positioned and “…banging on the radiator…” on the 
27TH of April, 2020 – which I affirm as ANNEXED in the AFFIDAVIT of 
MIWAKO G. MESSER, as I recall this intimate encounter in the flesh – was 
a trespass of the sanctity of my home while in the nude as seen from the 
corridor and the gazing eyes ANNEXED and entered by Defendants in the 
matter.
xii. ITEM 25
11 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to the mother of a 
resident, ANNE BRANDON – after having entered the AFFIDAVIT of ALEXIS 
BRANDON entered on the 11th of APRIL and the AFFIDAVIT of MIWAKO G. 
MESSER who under oath represents Miss Brandon having to leave on the 
12TH of April in light of the documented chronicle of information 
entered and sworn to by Defendants in the matter, notwithstanding Miss 
Ashley Humphries who notarized the Affidavit of John Doe as furthered 
hereunder on behalf of the ELSERS and the unlawful fees collected by the 
ZUCKERS, per the terms of their own lease.
xiii. ITEM 27
13 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating emails by 
and between the principles of the ZUCKER, namely Laurie Zucker, Anne 
Brandon, Paul Regan, Cory Weiss, and other members named above 
re-iterate that ALEXIS BRANDON is leaving the building, after 
demonstrating that she was already in California on the 11TH while ANNE 
BRANDON was purported to be writing emails to the named defendants in 
the matter who in fact harassed me at all times demonstrably as 
referenced in ITEM 4 as a tenant in one of their properties and 
throughout the term and lease agreement which terminated on the 31ST of 
December, 2020 whereby my STUDIO was understood to be their “Premises” 
under which I was photographed, documented in the AFFIDAVITS of their 
residents, and purported as legal residents of the building and address 
where I resided in the County of New York, addressed formerly at 111 
Sullivan Street, APT 2BR, New York, NY 10012.
xiv. ITEM 28
15 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating emails by 
and between the NEXUS of the ZUCKERS, whereby the window which provides 
egress to the fire-escape was damaged, boarded-up and was not repaired 
at any point in time. Despite the requests for EMERGENCY access, was 
deemed as appropriate in the ORAL ARGUMENT of SHARI S. LASKOWITZ, who on 
behalf of the YUZERS represented the interests of the ZUCKERS documented 
myself as locked out and capable of entering the premises as a basis of 
fitness. It was deemed of no consequence or urgency, as the Defendants 
in this matter were also neglectful of my physical health as furthered 
hereunder, despite the continuance as “chronicled” in the daily recount 
of my personal life. As referenced previously and during the time period 
referenced under ITEM 4 – obsessively would document each and every 
aspect of my life, certain of those claims are in fact a perjury under 
Federal and State Law, as sworn to under the AFFIDAVITS notarized by the 
ZUCKERS, YUZERS, and the ELSERS.
xv. ITEM 29
19 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating 
communications by and between the NEXUS of ZUCKERS, whereby I was 
documented as “calm” and also wearing “earbuds” – a claim in their first 
docket as admitted.
xvi. ITEM 30
19 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating 
communications by and between the NEXUS of ZUCKERS, whereby I was 
documented as owner of a “tape gun”, while videotaping, recording, and 
documenting my every step and motion referenced previously and during 
the time period referenced under ITEM 4 – obsessively and without my 
consent, destroyed the sanctity of my home in their coordinated 
observations entered by and on behalf of the ZUCKERS, YUZERS, and ELSERS 
was admittedly documented as closing my door was entered in the FEDERAL 
record as such and “twice in an hour’s time.” – which demonstrates a 
scrutinized violation of my privacy by all the NEXUS of Defendants named 
in the caption of this matter, sworn to under the AFFIDAVITS notarized 
by the ZUCKERS, YUZERS, and the ELSERS.
xvii. ITEM 32
21 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating 
communications by and between the NEXUS of ZUCKERS, whereby I was 
documented playing music and also during the onset of the Covid-19 
Pandemic – attest to finding a blue-mask.
xviii. ITEM 33
27 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating 
communications by and between the NEXUS of ZUCKERS, whereby I was 
documented “…banging on the radiator…” as referenced on the same date by 
as ANNEXED in the AFFIDAVIT of MIWAKO G. MESSER, whereby she attests to 
the location and departure of ALEXIS BRANDON, who notarized the letter 
on the same date emailed by her mother, purportedly as entered by 
Defendants in the matter – was more likely than not tampered with.
xix. ITEM 34
28 April 2020. Defendants attest and document to circulating 
communications by and between the NEXUS of ZUCKERS, in furtherance of 
myself documented “…banging on the radiator…” through the door was 
admitted by the YUZERS on behalf of the ZUCKERS as being “…watched… 
opening his door… outside of the front door frame…”

USC 18, § 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence
(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, 
induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage 
in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum 
term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more 
than one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the 
crime solicited, or both; or if the crime solicited is punishable by 
life imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty 
years.*
(15) <**voicemail attached>*
(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
(c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that the 
person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he lacked 
the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020
§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
(a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
-Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the United 
States irrespective of any provision of State law-
(1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used by a 
person involved in the offense;
(2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds the person 
obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation; and
(3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, or to 
facilitate the commission of, such violation.
The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in addition 
to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that the 
person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
(b) Procedures.-
(1) General.
-Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure and 
disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding in 
relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
(A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to be a reference 
to section 229A(a); and
(B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to subsection (a) 
of this section.
(2) Temporary restraining orders.-
(A) In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture proceedings under this 
section, a temporary restraining order may be entered upon application 
of the United States without notice or opportunity for a hearing when an 
information or indictment has not yet been filed with respect to the 
property, if, in addition to the circumstances described in section 
413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 
1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United States demonstrates that there is 
probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the 
order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject to 
forfeiture under this section and exigent circumstances exist that place 
the life or health of any person in danger.
(B) Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary restraining 
order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant authorizing 
the seizure of such property.
(C) Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time limits applicable to 
temporary restraining orders under section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the 
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 
853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining orders under 
this paragraph.
(c) Affirmative Defense.
-It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under subsection (b) 
that the property-
(1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
(2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is consistent 
with that purpose.
(d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall provide 
for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any chemical 
weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
(e) Assistance.
(f) Owner Liability.
-The owner or possessor of any property seized under this section shall 
be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred incident to the 
seizure, including any expenses relating to the handling, storage, 
transportation, and destruction or other disposition of the seized property

a final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United 
States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty 
prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the thing 
transferred or delivered on its behalf, or the reasonable value thereof.*

USC 18, §216. Penalties and injunctions**
(a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208, 
or 209 of this title is the following:**
(1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense shall be 
imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in the amount set forth 
in this title, or both.**
(2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the offense 
shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or fined in the amount 
set forth in this title, or both.**
(b) The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the appropriate 
United States district court against any person who engages in conduct 
constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 of 
this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a preponderance of the 
evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more 
than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of compensation which the 
person received or offered for the prohibited conduct, whichever amount 
is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty under this subsection does 
not preclude any other criminal or civil statutory, common law, or 
administrative remedy, which is available by law to the United States or 
any other person.**
(c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.*

        (a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct

        against the person of another in violation of the laws of the

        more than one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the
        punishment of the crime solicited, or both; or if the crime

        (b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this
        section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and
        complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant
        prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation
        is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or
        in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime
        until another time or to substitute another victim or another
        but similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative
        defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the
        defence by a preponderance of the evidence.<br>
        (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that
        the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because
        he lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because
        he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune
        from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.<br>

        =C2=A7229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons<br>
        (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.<br>
        -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the
        United States irrespective of any provision of State law-<br>
        (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used by
        a person involved in the offense;<br>
        (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds the
        person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such
        violation; and<br>
        (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit,
        or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.<br>
        The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in
        addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section
        229A(a), that the person forfeit to the United States all
        property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine
        otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a defendant who derived
        profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more
        than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.<br>
        (b) Procedures.-<br>
        (1) General.<br>
        -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure
        and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial
        proceeding in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections
        (b) through (p) of section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
        Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that
        any reference under those subsections to-<br>
        (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to be a
        reference to section 229A(a); and<br>
        (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to
        subsection (a) of this section.<br>
        (2) Temporary restraining orders.-<br>
        (A) In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture proceedings under
        this section, a temporary restraining order may be entered upon
        application of the United States without notice or opportunity
        for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet been
        filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the
        circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the
        Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21
        U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United States demonstrates that there is
        probable cause to believe that the property with respect to
        which the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be
        subject to forfeiture under this section and exigent
        circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person
        in danger.<br>
        (B) Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary
        restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a
        warrant authorizing the seizure of such property.<br>
        (C) Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time limits
        applicable to temporary restraining orders under section
        413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and
        Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to
        temporary restraining orders under this paragraph.<br>
        (c) Affirmative Defense.<br>
        -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under
        subsection (b) that the property-<br>
        (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons
        Convention; and<br>
        (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is
        consistent with that purpose.<br>
        (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall
        provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of
        any chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this
        section.<br>
        (e) Assistance.<br>
        (f) Owner Liability.<br>
        -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this
        section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses
        incurred incident to the seizure, including any expenses
        relating to the handling, storage, transportation, and
        destruction or other disposition of the seized property<br>

        (a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205,
        207, 208, or 209 of this title is the following:**<br>
        (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense

        (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the
        offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or
        fined in the amount set forth in this title, or both.**<br>
        (b) The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the
        appropriate United States district court against any person who
        engages in conduct constituting an offense under section 203,
        204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 of this title and, upon proof of such
        conduct by a preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be
        subject to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each
        violation or the amount of compensation which the person
        received or offered for the prohibited conduct, whichever amount
        is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty under this
        subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil
        statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is
        available by law to the United States or any other person.**<br>
        (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person
        is engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section
        203, 204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney
        General may petition an appropriate United States district court
        for an order prohibiting that person from engaging in such
        conduct. The court may issue an order prohibiting that person
        from engaging in such conduct if the court finds that the
        conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition
        under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is
