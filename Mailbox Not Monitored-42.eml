directors of the issuer.
     (b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of 
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to 
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control

been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in 
order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment, is an 
accessory after the fact. Except as otherwise expressly provided by any 
Act of Congress, an accessory after the fact shall be imprisoned not 
more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding

USC 18, § 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, 
induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage 
in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum 
term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more

*

***(15)    <**voicemail attached>*

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of

conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.**
**    (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.*

        in the aggregate to one percent of the outstanding securities of
        any one class, and do not confer, either in law or in fact, the
        power to elect one or more directors of the issuer.<br>

        (a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct
        constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted
        use, or threatened use of physical force against property or
        against the person of another in violation of the laws of the

        conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum
        term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not
        more than one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the

        (b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this
        section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and
        complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant
        prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation
        is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or
        in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime
        until another time or to substitute another victim or another
        but similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative
        defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the
        defence by a preponderance of the evidence.<br>
            (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section
        that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime
        because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission,
        because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is
        immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.<br>

        <br>
        §229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons<br>
            (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.<br>
            -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to
        the United States irrespective of any provision of State law-<br>
                (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or
        used by a person involved in the offense;<br>
                (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and
        proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the
        result of such violation; and<br>
                (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to
        commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.<br>
        <br>
            The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order,
        in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section
        229A(a), that the person forfeit to the United States all
        property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine
        otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a defendant who derived
        profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more
        than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.<br>
            (b) Procedures.-<br>
                (1) General.<br>
                -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any
        seizure and disposition thereof, and any administrative or
        judicial proceeding in relation thereto, shall be governed by
        subsections (b) through (p) of section 413 of the Comprehensive
        Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853),
        except that any reference under those subsections to-<br>
                    (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be
        deemed to be a reference to section 229A(a); and<br>
                    (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a
        reference to subsection (a) of this section.<br>
                (2) Temporary restraining orders.-<br>
                    (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture
        proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order
        may be entered upon application of the United States without
        notice or opportunity for a hearing when an information or
        indictment has not yet been filed with respect to the property,
        if, in addition to the circumstances described in section
        413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control
        Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United States
        demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the
        property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the
        event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section
        and exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of
        any person in danger.<br>
                    (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a
        temporary restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also
        issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of such property.<br>
                    (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and
        time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under
        section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
        Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3))
        shall apply to temporary restraining orders under this
        paragraph.<br>
            (c) Affirmative Defense.<br>
                -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under
        subsection (b) that the property-<br>
                (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical
        Weapons Convention; and<br>
                (2) is of a type and quantity that under the
        circumstances is consistent with that purpose.<br>
            (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General
        shall provide for the destruction or other appropriate
        disposition of any chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant
        to this section.<br>
            (e) Assistance.<br>
            (f) Owner Liability.<br>
                -The owner or possessor of any property seized under
        this section shall be liable to the United States for any
        expenses incurred incident to the seizure, including any
        expenses relating to the handling, storage, transportation, and
        destruction or other disposition of the seized property<br>

        **        (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the

        in the amount set forth in this title, or both.**<br>
        **        (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct
        constituting the offense shall be imprisoned for not more than
        five years or fined in the amount set forth in this title, or
        both.**<br>
        **    (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil action in
        the appropriate United States district court against any person
        who engages in conduct constituting an offense under section
        203, 204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 of this title and, upon proof of
        such conduct by a preponderance of the evidence, such person
        shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for
        each violation or the amount of compensation which the person
        received or offered for the prohibited conduct, whichever amount
        is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty under this
        subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil
        statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is
        available by law to the United States or any other person.**<br>
        **    (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a
        person is engaging in conduct constituting an offense under
        section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 of this title, the
        Attorney General may petition an appropriate United States
        district court for an order prohibiting that person from
        engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order

        filing of a petition under this section does not preclude any
