    do not open these emails until you feel like it.

    Also, just keep this in case the Zuckers don't want to have this information to hold against them in court later.

    -- even thought inalready filed it without action from the judge, so let me know where did that $6,000,000 come from.

    They change their emails constantly, keyword search: AIMA.

    Redundsnt email required in colocation, dont know who does that at one state farm... 














    Do those deposits match up with the gross incomes reported for the 6 properties in question, YoY and every year as reported to the NY dept of Finance, and purport double digit return which over lunch, is a great marketing document to raise money for their Limited Paprtnership -- 

    How would they see something likenthat everyday? 
    By different people?
    Play-by-play also......


    Those checks, known by the Entities and counselors:
     --- deposited into an interest bearing account in ESCROW, where do they list that on the left or the right side as a credit or a liability? 

    To satisfy their reserve reequirements with the Treasury, or we are you planning on hiding those charges as well, aided and abetted by the counselors of the Zucker compound of entities, directors, and lawyers, and counselors.

    /S/ BO DINCER.

        Subject: if you're an adversary to the wilson elser firm. Or anyone.
        Just flash this deck right here in court. But dont look at it first. Forward it to their counselors then bring it in a air sealed bag and ask them: you read this pack?

        Then give it to the judge, like I did -- thing is, my files got processed and were also evaluated by the judge, clerk, and all of the Plaintiffâ€™s counselors.

        Index 153974/2020 50074 CIK 93715 [1516523]

        - covered for violations under USC Title 18, namely under continuing financial crimes, 18.215, 18.21, 18.225, 18.4, 18.3, 18.2.

        One love.
