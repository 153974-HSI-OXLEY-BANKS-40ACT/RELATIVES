(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands,

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.**
**    (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.*

integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such 
officer or employee;
         (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of 
Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and 
employees covered by this section, and published in the Federal

pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved; or

particular matter involved is that resulting solely from the interest of 
the officer or employee, or his or her spouse or minor child, in

parties.

exemption under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(3) shall be made available to 
the public by the agency granting the exemption pursuant to the

1978. In making such determination available, the agency may withhold 
from disclosure any information contained in the determination that

Attorney General, shall issue uniform regulations for the issuance of

              (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.<br>
              -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit
          to the United States irrespective of any provision of State
          law-<br>
                  (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed,
          or used by a person involved in the offense;<br>
                  (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and
          proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the

          section 229A(a), that the person forfeit to the United States
          all property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine
          otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a defendant who
          derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined
          not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.<br>
              (b) Procedures.-<br>
                  (1) General.<br>
                  -Property subject to forfeiture under this section,
          any seizure and disposition thereof, and any administrative or
          judicial proceeding in relation thereto, shall be governed by
          subsections (b) through (p) of section 413 of the
          Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970
          (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those
          subsections to-<br>
                      (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be
          deemed to be a reference to section 229A(a); and<br>
                      (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a
          reference to subsection (a) of this section.<br>
                  (2) Temporary restraining orders.-<br>
                      (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture
          proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order
          may be entered upon application of the United States without
          notice or opportunity for a hearing when an information or
          indictment has not yet been filed with respect to the
          property, if, in addition to the circumstances described in
          section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention
          and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United
          States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe
          that the property with respect to which the order is sought
          would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture
          under this section and exigent circumstances exist that place
          the life or health of any person in danger.<br>
                      (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a
          temporary restraining order under this paragraph, it shall
          also issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of such property.<br>
                      (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and
          time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under
          section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
          Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and
          (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining orders under this
          paragraph.    <br>
              (c) Affirmative Defense.<br>
                  -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture
          under subsection (b) that the property-<br>
                  (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical
          Weapons Convention; and<br>
                  (2) is of a type and quantity that under the
          circumstances is consistent with that purpose.<br>
              (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General
          shall provide for the destruction or other appropriate
          disposition of any chemical weapon seized and forfeited
          pursuant to this section.<br>
              (e) Assistance.<br>
              (f) Owner Liability.<br>
                  -The owner or possessor of any property seized under
          this section shall be liable to the United States for any
          expenses incurred incident to the seizure, including any
          expenses relating to the handling, storage, transportation,
          and destruction or other disposition of the seized property</font></font></p>
